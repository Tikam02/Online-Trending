### Developers Guide To Contribute

#### Make Sure That you know proper Git commands before Contributing to thise project, if don't then this tutorial will help.
### [Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) 
#### To create a branch from Terminal
```
    $ git fetch && git checkout dev

    Make your changes locally and then add, commit, and push your changes to the <feature> branch:
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "adding a change from the dev"
    $ git push origin dev
```

********
#### Perfect way to git when doing project with your team.
When you have made some changes and and your friend has already pushed it and want you  to pull it.
so, if you pull it git will display first commit your changes or merge the files,that will cause merge conflict.
You can overcome this by:

Stash your local changes:

```
git stash
```

Update the branch to the latest code

```
git pull origin dev
```

see your commits from stash 
```
git stash show
```

Merge your local changes into the latest code:

```
git stash apply
```

Add, commit and push your changes

```
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
git push origin dev

```
******
To create a branch locally

You can create a branch locally as long as you have a cloned version of the repo.
```
    From your terminal window, list the branches on your repository.
    $ git branch
    dev
    *master

    This output indicates there is a single branch, the master and the asterisk indicates it is currently active.
    
    Create a new feature branch in the repository
    $ git branch dev

    Switch to the feature branch to work on it.
    $ git checkout dev

    You can list the branches again with the git branch command.

    Commit the change to the feature branch:
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "adding a change to the dev branch"

    Push the dev branch to Repository
    $ git push origin dev
    
    Switch back to the master branch.
    $ git checkout master
    
```

### To Revert The commited Files 
```
 git revert <commit-id> 
 git reset 
 git add <path> 
 git commit ... 
 git reset --hard # making sure you didn't have uncommited changes earlier
 ```
